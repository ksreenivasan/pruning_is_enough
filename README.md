## Rare Gems: Finding Lottery Tickets at Initialization

### Overview
---
It has been widely observed that large neural networks can be pruned to a small fraction of their original size, with little loss in accuracy, by typically following a time-consuming "train, prune, re-train" approach. Frankle & Carbin (2018) conjecture that we can avoid this by training lottery tickets, i.e., special sparse subnetworks found at initialization, that can be trained to high accuracy. However, a subsequent line of work presents concrete evidence that current algorithms for finding trainable networks at initialization, fail simple baseline comparisons, e.g., against training random sparse subnetworks. Finding lottery tickets that train to better accuracy compared to simple baselines remains an open problem. In this work, we partially resolve this open problem by discovering rare gems: subnetworks at initialization that attain considerable accuracy, even before training. Refining these rare gems - "by means of fine-tuning" - beats current baselines and leads to accuracy competitive or better than magnitude pruning methods.

### Depdendencies (tentative)
---
Tested stable dependencies:
* python 3.6.5 (Anaconda)
* PyTorch 1.1.0
* torchvision 0.2.2
* CUDA 10.0.130
* cuDNN 7.5.1
* tensorboard
* tqdm
* ffcv (If you want to run ffcv imagenet)

### Data Preparation
---
1. For `tinyimagenet`, run `load_tiny_imagenet.sh`
2. For `imagenet`, you will need to download `imagenet` and specify the path in `data/imagenet.py` (Currently in branch. Will be merged soon)

### Running Experients:
---
The main script is `main.py`, to launch the jobs, we provide scripts `./cifar_exec.sh`, `imp_exec.sh`. And we provide a description of the main arguments. For more detailed descriptions, refer to `args_helper.py`.


| Argument                      | Description                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `algo` | Specify the algorithm to run. `hc|ep|hc_iter|wt`. Note that GM is `hc_iter` in the code. |
| `lr` | Inital learning rate that will be used for the pruning process. |
| `fine_tune_lr` | Inital learning rate that will be used for the finetuning process. |
| `batch-size` | Batch size for the optimizers e.g. SGD or Adam. |
| `optimizer` | `sgd` or `adam`. |
| `dataset`      | Dataset to use. |
| `arch`      | Model to use. |
| `gamma` | the factor of learning rate decay, i.e. the effective learning rate is `lr*gamma^t`. |
| `iter_period` | Specifically for `hc_iter`, how often to run iterative thresholding. |
| `conv_type` | Will almost always be `SubnetConv` for pruning. |
| `target_sparsity` | Specify the target sparsity for the ticket. |
| `unflag_before_finetune` | Restore weights if the regularizer killed too many. |
| `init` | Weight initialization distribution. |
| `score_init` | Score initialization distribution. |
| `hc_quantized` | Enable for GM since it will round on forward pass. |
| `regularization` | `L2|L1` |
| `lmbda` | Regularization weight. |
| `gpu` | Specify which gpu to run on. |
